install_config_files.py is a script that allows you to keep your config files is a separate directory, and helps you creating symlinks to them.

GLOSSARY:
original directory: the directory your config files originally shared in common, i.e: your home dir
config directory: the (new) directory to keep config files
data directory: a config directory you want to link. see below



How to keep config files in a separate directory:
    -create an empty directory
    -move each config file you want to it, keeping the path (relative to the original directory). Example: move "/home/user/.config/program/settings.conf" to "newdir/.config/program/settings.conf"

After a config directory is created, name it "config", and copy the script to it's parent directory.



The script processes each directory and file inside "config". It takes the following actions (python-pseudocode):
    For a directory:
        if it's a "data directory":
            treat directory as file
        else:
            mkdir if inexistent in original directory
            recurse into it
    for a file:
        backup if existent in original directory
        symlink it to the original directory
        
It also takes the following precations:
    check for broken, existing, and outdated links

On some circunstances, it might be desirable to link whole directories, instead of single files - for example, if you have dynamic file names
(a directory with logs, etc). These directories shall be known as "data directories", and, to enable the program to recognize them, the extension "..install_config_files_DATA" shall be appended.
